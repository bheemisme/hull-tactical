# Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the **initial data exploration and analysis phase**. The existing Jupyter notebook (`index.ipynb`) demonstrates basic data loading and schema verification, with preliminary analysis of feature distributions and data types.

### Completed Work

- **Data Loading**: Successfully loaded training data using Polars
- **Schema Verification**: Confirmed data structure matches expected schema with 100+ features across 8 categories
- **Basic EDA**: Initial feature categorization and null value checking
- **Feature Type Casting**: Converted macroeconomic features (E1-E20) to Float64 for numerical analysis
- **Custom Metric Implementation**: Complete evaluation metric (`metric.py`) with volatility-adjusted Sharpe ratio
- **Data Description Documentation**: Created comprehensive data description with target variable definitions and feature categorization (referenced in agents.md)
- **EDA Notebook and Utilities**: Created `v1.ipynb` with data loading, column info summary, and feature type counts; developed `eda/utils.py`, `eda/queries.py`, `eda/plots.py`, and `eda/process.py` with comprehensive utility functions for data analysis, querying, visualization, and processing; created `requirements.txt` with project dependencies; added `get_feature_counts` to queries.py for aggregated null/non-null counts by feature type; implemented `create_lagged_targets` in process.py for shifting target variables
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented `preprocess.py` for loading data, removing dummy features, type casting, creating lagged targets, and splitting into train/eval sets
- **Model Training**: Created `train.py` for training and evaluating XGBRegressor, LGBMRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor on all three targets using MSE, with results saved to CSV
- **Model Inference**: Implemented `predict.py` for Kaggle competition inference with loaded models from checkpoints
- **Kaggle Evaluation Setup**: Added `kaggle_evaluation/` directory with inference server for competition submission
- **Model Checkpoints**: Created `checkpoints/` directory for saved trained models
- **Test Data**: Added `data/test.csv` for evaluation
- **Custom Metric**: Implemented `metric.py` with volatility-adjusted Sharpe ratio for evaluation
- **Project Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation in `agents.md`, `data_description.md`, `README.md` with project overview, data schema, and workflow

### Current State Analysis

- **Data Quality**: Extensive missing values early in the historic dataset, but target variables have zero nulls in training data
- **Feature Categories**: Successfully identified and categorized all 8 feature types:
  - Technical/Market Dynamics (M): M1-M18
  - Macroeconomic (E): E1-E20
  - Interest Rate (I): I1-I9
  - Price/Valuation (P): P1-P13
  - Volatility (V): V1-V13
  - Sentiment (S): S1-S12
  - Momentum (MOM): M1-M18
  - Dummy/Binary (D): D1-D9
- **Time Series**: Approximately 15+ years of daily trading data available, indexed by date_id
- **Test Set Structure**: Includes all training features plus lagged versions of target variables (lagged_forward_returns, lagged_risk_free_rate, lagged_market_forward_excess_returns)
- **Evaluation Framework**: Custom metric implemented with proper position constraints (0-2 range)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 weeks)

1. **Comprehensive EDA**: Complete exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries and visualizations
2. **Feature Engineering**: Develop feature processing pipeline for all 8 feature categories
3. **Baseline Models**: Implement and evaluate baseline models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
4. **Data Splitting Strategy**: Design time series cross-validation approach

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 months)

1. **Advanced Modeling**: Implement XGBoost and LightGBM with hyperparameter tuning
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify most predictive features using statistical tests and model-based importance
3. **Model Stacking**: Develop ensemble approaches combining multiple algorithms
4. **Risk Management Integration**: Incorporate volatility constraints into model development

### Long-term Objectives (Next 3-6 months)

1. **Production Pipeline**: Build end-to-end prediction pipeline
2. **Backtesting Framework**: Implement historical performance testing
3. **Model Interpretability**: Add feature importance and model explanation capabilities
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for computational efficiency and scalability
